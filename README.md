### Hi ğŸ‘‹!
<br/>
I'm Mario JimÃ©nez FernÃ¡ndez
<br/>
IÂ´m a junior dev student currently studying at Factoria F5 Bootcamp of Fullstack for 6 months.
[3 Months of 6 six completed!]
I decided to change my focus from the game industry as an 3D modeller, Concept Artist and Indie Developer to this new field.
