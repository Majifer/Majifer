### Hi 👋!
<br/>
I'm Mario Jiménez Fernández
<br/><br/>
I´m a junior dev student currently studying at Factoria F5 Bootcamp of Fullstack for 6 months.
[3 Months of 6 six completed!]
I decided to change my focus from the game industry as an 3D modeller, Concept Artist and Indie Developer to this new field.
